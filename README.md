# HelpCall-extension

A chromium-based browser extension of HelpCall, implemented to serve as a high-fidelity prototype for later-stage evaluation of the design. While recording, it captures the steps performed on any website and displays each as a tooltip. The whole sequence of tooltips can be saved as a local guide that users can pull up again whenever they want.

## Installation
To install the extension, go to your browser's Extensions page (e.g., edge://extensions/) and toggle on the "Developer mode". Then choose, "Load unpacked" and choose the extension folder.
